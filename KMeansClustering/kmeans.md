## Background
I acquired data on blood tests designed to diagnose liver disorders from the [University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Data repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Liver+Disorders).

The dataset consists of 345 instances with 7 variates, of which 5 are blood test results, which will form the basis of my investigation.

| Variate | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| mcv  | mean corpuscular volume |
| alkphos | alkaline phosphotase |
| sgpt | alamine aminotransferase |
| sgot | aspartate aminotransferase |
| gammagt | gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase |
| drinks | number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day |
| selector | field used to split data into two sets |
